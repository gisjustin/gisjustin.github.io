    <h3><a href="http://maps.iu.edu/Bloomington.php">Launch of maps.iu.edu:</a></h3>
		<p>I am quite proud to say that the ArcGIS Server based map application is now launched.  This application is now the "official" campus map.
        I worked with the data owners in the University Architect's office and Facilities Management personnel to publish their data via ArcGIS server.  Staff from the Office of Creative Services provided the icons and overall layout, but I am solely responsible for developing the application.  This was a unique project in that the application resides on the IU Intellegent Infrastructure.  This is a virtual server running ArcGIS Server and using the ArcGISFlex API.  A PHP script checks for the client type on the page request, and if it is a mobile device, sends the user to the IU Mobile Maps application.  IU Mobile will soon be incorporating this map service into their mobile map aplication!  A preview of how this will work on their Google API based map is <a href="http://bl-uits-granger.ads.iu.edu/find.html">here.</a></p>
		
      <h3>Summer Session Highlights:</h3>
		<p>I completed 9 graduate hours this summer session.  That is technically a full time student.  It would not have been that demanding except that I am also a full time staff...</p>
        <p>Anyway, here are a few of my completed projects:</p>
      <p><a href="http://ella.slis.indiana.edu/~jppeters/s603/Final/index.php">PHP Secure Mapping Application</a>  This project uses a Postgres database and PHP to store username, password, and location information.  All of the users can be located on the map.  The map uses client side ArcGIS javascript API for mapping locations from passed PHP values.  I might pick the project up again soon.  Very cool and the API, PHP, and Postgres are all free to use...</p>
      <p><a href="./S603ABM.swf">Agent Analyst ArcGIS Extension Modeling </a>Complex modeling of "Agents" based on input parameters.  I used the new Indiana House districts that came out of the redistricting based on 2010 census data.  An accompanying paper can be found <a href="./PetersS603ABM.docx">here.</a> </p>
        
        &nbsp;<a href="./MapBlast.html">Map Blast:</a>  This is the first in a series of interactive educational puzzles for Geography students.
<h3>IU Building Locator App for Android</h3>
		<p>I built this app soon after becoming an IU employee and Student to orient myself with campus.  In the spirit of Android, I offer it free from the Android Market.  Check out the details <a href="./Locator.html">here.</a>
