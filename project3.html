Figure 1.  Biggest exporters of Rice by Ronnie Ganwani, Created with Many Eyes, Data Source Unknown,<a href="http://www-958.ibm.com/software/data/cognos/manyeyes/visualizations/biggest-exporters-of-rice-by-ronni"> Link to original.</a></h22>
			<iv><p></br><br/>I chose the original visualization above because I thought that it was an interesting temporal and geographic dataset involving exports for many years of a staple food source for much of the world.  The visualization did provide interesting insights, in that many of the geographically largest countries of the world are not the largest exporters of rice, and that some smaller nations that observers may not associate with food production and export are, in fact, large exporters.   While the original visualization above does provide many insights into the data, there were several items related to visual perception principles that could be improved upon.  Although some of the items I chose to redesign could most likely be contributed to the limitations of the software used to create the visualization, there are also items that should have been addressed to improve visual perception principles within the current visualization, even with any imposed software constraints. </p>
            <p>  
Immediately upon viewing the original visualization, I had trouble distinguishing the size of the bubble and the corresponding value on the legend.  The visual field of view makes it difficult for humans to view the map and the legend at the same time.  It would often require visualizing the map to see the bubble size and then finding the appropriate bubble size on the legend for the corresponding value of exports.  The “many eyes” environment does allow for some interactivity by hovering on each bubble to see the corresponding value, so a viewer can retrieve the information to supplement the legend.  The fact that the legend also shows classes of values that are not present in the data, seems like an issue that requires addressing in any re-design.  The top exporter value was 8.6M tons and the next nearest value was 3.4M tons.  The legend for the bubbles has a top value of 5M-6M+.  I do not feel that this accurately portrays the only value that would fit in this class of 8.6M.  The second largest class within the legend has values of 4M-5M, which does not have any members from the data fitting into that classification.</p>
<p>  Since the title the author chose to name the visualization is “Biggest exporters of Rice”, the smaller values, within the 0-100K classification, should probably not be included.  The export numbers within this classification do not even reach a tenth of one percent of the largest exporter and many have values of zero.  If the visualization was “Global Rice Exports” or something similar, including the data with zero exports or very small exports would be appropriate.  I addressed this in my re-design by not including a bar graph for values below one tenth of one percent of the largest exporter, though the data for these countries can still be accessed via the map interactivity and hovering over the country.  </p>
<p>  The data does not seem to be displayed as prominently as it should within the original visualization.  The color of the bubble does not adequately distinguish itself from the background world map.  Differences in size, width, and length are all tasks that can be pre-attentively processed easily by humans.  By using bar graphs as opposed to similar sized circles, the re-designed visualization aims to make comparisons among the data more distinguishable.  By also using a color that has a high luminance contrast from that of the background (yellow in my re-design), the data also becomes more prominent.  I have also introduced an element of shading and stereoscopic depth perception to the graph bars as an additional visual perception principle to enhance the difference in sizes of the bar graphs.</p>
	
    <p>  The re-design below addresses the previously mentioned critiques with the primary goal of applying visual perception principles to make comparisons among the data more distinguishable.  </p>
