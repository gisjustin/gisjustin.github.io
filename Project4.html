The column of numbers of employees for each occupation seems not very helpful to represent the overall trend of salary changes between occupations. Therefore, in data transformation, this employee number column was extracted. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">There are approximately 150 data points in the transformed new data set. Each data point represents the average salary earned by one occupation in a given year. By looking at the data set, it would be hard to see the increase and decrease of salaries earned by a single occupation over years, and it would be also baffling to make comparisons on average salaries between occupations. Therefore, the visualizations that represented these trends and comparisons would be conducive to draw those insights.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">After adjusting inflation rates for the data, an Excel file was created that contains the new data set and used the Excel chart tool to generate a bar chart using the new data set (see Link 1). The bar chart instantly displays the overall trends of how much people made in the university and the changes over years for each occupation. The X axis was set to represent the salary, Y the occupations. Years were color coded as a legend list by the chart. The problem with the bar chart is that a lot of space under the value ($) 30,000 is wasted. Moreover, each column is too slim to tell apart from other columns, hampering the overall perception of changes of average salaries.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">After getting feedback from various outside audiences, a line chart (see Link 2) was introduced in place of the bar chart. In addition, for showing a more visual change of average salaries over years, the years became the X axis and occupations a series of color coded legends by the chart. In the line chart, the rank of average salaries earned by the fourteen occupations became more visual by layering them from top to bottom, which would potentially help audiences grasp the overall picture of the average salary earned by different occupations at Indiana University. Also, each curvy line represents the fluctuation of average salaries for a given occupation over years, and achieved the primary goal of creating the visualization. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The major barrier encountered in the process was the color coding system. In the &ldquo;before&rdquo; visualization, colors originally installed in in the Excel chart tool system on the graph were disposed and replaced with three colors (red, blue and green). These three colors were later sliced into more colors with different saturation to represent the columns for each occupation. The gradient color coding system was meant to avoid the distraction created by too many colors; however, as a result, the feedback showed that this color coding system created difficulties for users to tell the slender bars apart. Consequently, in the second design (line chart) of the visualization, the default color coding system for the line chart was chosen. However, minor changes were made to highlight some lines whose original colors were not visually apparent. Although in later tests, this new color coding strategy seemed effective, it did risk the cognitive principles made by researchers in IV by using more than twelve different colors. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Link 1: Original visualization (bar chart): </span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="http://s637.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/s637-project-4-temporal-data-display-_-geng.pdf">http://s637.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/s637-project-4-temporal-data-display-_-geng.pdf</a></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Link 2: Redesigned visualization (line chart): </span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="http://s637.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/s637-project-4-temporal-data-display_gz_line.pdf">http://s637.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/s637-project-4-temporal-data-display_gz_line.pdf</a></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The transformed data set used: </span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="http://s637.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/s637-project-4-temporal-data-display-raw-data_gz.xls">http://s637.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/s637-project-4-temporal-data-display-raw-data_gz.xls</a></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><ol class="c7" start="1"><li class="c0 c3"><span class="c4">Small multiples display (2D substrate)</span></li></ol><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Data was derived from an instructor-provided set of Indiana University campus (year_ average salaries by department, campus department size, campus, and year together. &nbsp;For each campus, a table was made containing the year, and an average salary for each year was determined by multiplying each of the campus&#39; department&#39;s average salary by its size and then adding up the figures to obtain a total workforce &#39;pay budget&#39;. &nbsp;This figure was divided by the total workforce size of the campus to arrive at a campus average salary for that year. &nbsp;Each salary was then adjusted for the US Consumer Price Index (a measure of inflation). &nbsp;Two campuses (Indianapolis and Bloomington) had their employees split into auxiliary and non-auxiliary divisions; these divisions were combined in order to provide a bigger picture for each campus as a whole. &nbsp;Lastly, salary data for all campus administrators as well as data for pay given at the hospitals was also offered; the former was excluded since administrators were not classified by campus; the latter due to the fact that only two years of data were available.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Original Visualization: </span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="http://limestonerock.net/anandk/637/media/a4smdraft.png">http://limestonerock.net/anandk/637/media/a4smdraft.png</a></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Redesign: &nbsp;</span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="http://limestonerock.net/anandk/637/media/a4smmfinal.png">http://limestonerock.net/anandk/637/media/a4smmfinal.png</a></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Computed data: </span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="http://limestonerock.net/anandk/637/4smdata.pdf">http://limestonerock.net/anandk/637/4smdata.pdf</a></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><ol class="c7" start="1"><li class="c0 c3"><span class="c4">Overlaid on a</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Map of Indiana</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(Geospatial substrate).</span></li></ol><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4 c11"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">For the geospatial substrate visualization, the data that made the most sense to visualize was that of the employees per campus for each organization. &nbsp;There are approximately 10,000 records for the organization ranging from 1995 &ndash; 2007. &nbsp;To visualize each record individually on a map would create a cluttered map and many individual records would be occluded by records with larger symbol sizes. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">It would have been appropriate to summarize the data, and visualize a total number of employees for each campus, regardless of organization. &nbsp;Although such a visualization, using totals per campus, may not provide the level of granularity that the data supports. &nbsp;Users of the visualization would most likely be interested in a specific organization and the change in that organization&rsquo;s employee numbers over time, which would visualize the data closer to the format that it was provided.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">To enable this level of detail when visualizing the data geospatially, an option to filter the data and observe the data temporally was employed. To make the data the most visible, and stand out from that of the map background, a grey scale map was used and color was only used for the symbols. &nbsp;This greyscale map background was also chosen to maximize the data to ink ratio. &nbsp;A coding of bubble size was used to correspond to the number of employees. &nbsp;This commonly used coding should be familiar to most users of the visualization and a corresponding legend allows for further clarification of the data visualized.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The original visualization: </span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="http://ella.slis.indiana.edu/~jppeters/S637/Geospatial.html">http://ella.slis.indiana.edu/~jppeters/S637/Geospatial.html</a></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The redesigned visualization: </span><span class="c2"><a class="c5" href="http://ella.slis.indiana.edu/~jppeters/S637/GeospatialV2.html">http://ella.slis.indiana.edu/~jppeters/S637/GeospatialV2.html</a></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c6">Data insights and findings</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><ol class="c7" start="1"><li class="c0 c3"><span class="c4">Findings in the Temporal Data Display &nbsp;- Average Salary Earned by Occupation at Indiana University 1995-2007:</span></li></ol><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Overall, the highest salaries were earned by physicians, faculty members, and librarians at Indiana University among the fourteen occupations in the data set. Among them, the average salary for physicians is significantly higher than the other highest occupations. The main trend of these streams are quite flat except the Physician. The average salary earned by physicians at Indiana University was on a steady rise from 1998 - 2002. However, lacking of data after 2002, it would be hard to tell whether it continued the increase between then and now. In addition, the lowest average salary was earned by the occupation Nursing Assistant according to the chart, which indicates that if all occupations at Indiana University in the data set considered, no employee would earn below $15,000 between 1995-2007 (based on available data). &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Clusters of occupations earning the similar average salaries are shown in the chart too. Notably, General Supervision, Technical, Research Tech, Service Maintenance, and Support Staff were approximately in the same range ($21,000-$25,000) in terms of average salaries. In addition, Professional Staff and Nurse seem to be positively corresponding to each other in terms of the ups and downs of their average salaries over the years. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><ol class="c7" start="1"><li class="c0 c3"><span class="c4">Findings in the Small multiples display (2D substrate):</span></li></ol><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">From the visualization, we gain insights as to each campus&#39; philosophy of human resources (HR). &nbsp;At some point, half of the campuses went through expansionary phases, increasing workforce size and average pay simultaneously. &nbsp;For all campuses that had such expansions (Indianapolis, South Bend, Southeast, East), it seems that eventually, an abrupt collapse of average worker pay struck. &nbsp;In the case of the former three campuses, the steepest drop in pay seems to have occurred after 2004. &nbsp;The East campus seemed to have experienced this phenomenon earlier (workforce collapsing in 1997), making it a slight outlier amongst campuses that experienced this expansion/collapse phenomenon. &nbsp;In addition, the East campus experienced a reduction in wages and workforce size in 2006, corresponding to a lower amount of money being spent on workforce pay.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Major exceptions and outliers to this expansionary &quot;rule&quot; exist (only half of the campuses followed it to begin with), but in drastically different ways. &nbsp;The Bloomington campus seems to be immune to the &quot;wage collapse&quot; seen by some of the other campuses despite constant recent workforce size growth; one wonders if it is about to see the same type of wage collapse its sister campuses did. &nbsp;The Northwest campus seems increase workforce size at the expense of average salary; Ft. Wayne shows the opposite behavior in both directions. &nbsp;While the Northwest campus&#39; line progresses in loopy fits and starts moving down and to the right, the Ft. Wayne campus line progresses in a relatively straightforward manner moving up and to the left. &nbsp;It does seem that the Northwest campus may have gone through some hiring turmoil, while the Ft. Wayne campus experienced a steady decrease in the number of workers, with remaining workers enjoying better pay, and the data support this conclusion</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Finally, there exists the strong outlier phenomenon of the Kokomo campus. &nbsp;Not resembling a traditional line, it seems that cyclical behavior in workforce size vs. pay is seen, moving in a clockwise fashion. &nbsp;While we could conclude that Kokomo&#39;s campus HR runs in &quot;cycles&quot;, we cannot gain any insight as to how with the given data.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><ol class="c7" start="1"><li class="c0 c3"><span class="c4">Findings in the Geospatial Data Display &nbsp;- Employees per Campus by Organization, Indiana University 1995-2007:</span></li></ol><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The number of employees changed frequently for most of the organizations, but the changes were not dramatic in most cases. &nbsp;The default organization of SLIS remained relatively stable with employees only in the Bloomington and Indianapolis campus during the timframe of the dataset. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Some of the larger organizations such as BUS, did have large changes in the number of employees per campus and even some cases where the number of employees changes dramatically from year to year. &nbsp;As the data is examined, it is evident that some organizations removed all employees from certain campuses during a specific year. &nbsp;The visualization does provide the user insight into regional campus growth. &nbsp;Numerous examples of organizations opening departments at regional campuses can be easily visualized by displaying the data geographically. &nbsp;While the raw data, in tabular format, may provide that insight, it is much more apparent and easier to interpret when viewing the data temporally via the geospatial visualization. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4 c6"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c6">Comparisons</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The temporal and the small multiples visualizations contain comprehensive information distilled from original data sets and will provide the users the ability to draw immediate insights on trends and patterns into all the data presented, whereas the geospatial visualization filters the data immediately visible to the user. &nbsp;The ability to draw insights from the interactivity visualization requires the user to invest some time with the application. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">An additional comparison amongst the 3 visualizations, is the number of data records displayed within the visualizations. &nbsp;The temporal and the small multiples visualizations include 96 and 150 records to be visualized. &nbsp;The geospatial visualization has access to approximately 10,000 records. &nbsp;To make that much data available in a geospatial visualization, much of the data would become occluded.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4 c6"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c6">Informal validation</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4 c6"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The original visualization (bar chart) was sent to four students that were not involved in this project. Overall they reflected that the chart was easy to understand and find trends. However, some pointed out there were confusions or difficulties when perusing information on the chart. These suggestions and subsequent solutions are presented, respectively, below:</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Sophie Parkison - &nbsp;Sophie mentioned the columns between 1996 - 1999 were hard to distinguish. Partly It was due to the gradient colors used to paint those slender columns for each years. This became a major design change afterwards in the second version.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Danqing Liu - Danqing pointed out the there were no explicit notes telling the missing data of some of the years on the graph. Notes added in the second version.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Jennifer Talbott - Jennifer contributed that a line graph might be better for her to understand visually and cognitively than a bar chart. This suggestion lent itself to the major conversion from the bar chart to the line chart in the second version. Additionally, the second version incorporated Angela Zoss&rsquo;s suggestion that the X axis could be years instead of occupations for readers to see more of a &ldquo;temporal&rdquo; change of average salaries. &nbsp;Same as Danqing, Jennifer also pointed out the missing data for some of the years. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">ii.
