			 <h3><a href="http://maps.indiana.edu">IndianaMap</a></h3>
		<h24>I started adding enhanced functionality and a redisign of the user interface of the IndianaMap soon after arriving at the Indiana Geological Survey.  I am the lead developer for the IndianaMap and very proud of the current application.  It is designed to work in all browsers and with mobile devices without any required plugins.  It only uses the ArcGIS Javascript API with Javascript and JQuery, making it accessible to the most users possible.  
        </h24>
             
             <h3><a href="http://maps.iu.edu/Bloomington.php">Launch of maps.iu.edu:</a></h3>
		<h24>The ArcGIS Server based map application is now launched.  This application is now the "official" campus map(s).
        I worked with the data owners in the University Architect's office and Facilities Management personnel to publish their data via ArcGIS server.  Staff from the Office of Creative Services provided the icons and overall layout, but I am solely responsible for developing the application.  This was a unique project in that the application resides on the IU Intellegent Infrastructure.  This is a virtual server running ArcGIS Server and using the ArcGISFlex API.  A PHP script checks for the client type on the page request, and if it is a mobile device, sends the user to the IU Mobile Maps application.  IU Mobile has incorporated this map service into their mobile map application!  Check out the mobile version <a href="https://m.iu.edu/kme-prd/campus/select?toolName=maps&campus=BL">here</a> and other campuses below: </p>

      <h3><a href="http://gis.iu.edu/">Indiana Spatial Data Portal (gis.iu.edu)</a></h3>
		<h24>The Indiana Spatial Data Portal (ISDP), an IndianaMap asset, provides several ways of viewing and downloading Indiana spatial data. Through a unique partnership with the State of Indiana, Indiana localities, the Indiana Geographic Information Council, Federal Agencies, and Indiana University, the ISDP provides access to over 20 terabytes of geospatial information.</p>
        </br>	
I presented at the November 2011 annual URISA conference on the Indiana Spatial Data Portal (ISDP)
<a href="http://www.urisa.org/gp11-32"> newly added services.</a>
</br>	
</br>
The ISDP won an <a href="http://www.igic.org/realworld/pubuits.html"> award </a> from the Indiana Geographic Council for the expanded services we recenlty began to offer.  A <a href="https://pti.iu.edu/video/GIS">video </a> about the ISDP from the pervasive technology institute explains some of these new services.
