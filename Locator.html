		<h3>IU Building Locator V1</h3>
		&nbsp;<p>While I am an employee of Indiana University, this application is NOT 
            supported/endorsed/affiliated with Indiana University in any way.&nbsp; I built 
            this app in my spare time and I make it available free of charge for download.&nbsp; 
            Since there is no cost please give me feedback via the Android Market.&nbsp; It 
            only takes a couple of minutes and you got a free app out of the deal.&nbsp; Let 
            me know of any issues with the app or if there are locations/features you would 
            like included.&nbsp; Please include your phone model and any other appropriate 
            details.&nbsp; <a href="mailto:mapper222@gmail.com">mapper222@gmail.com</a></p>

       	<h3>Attention Bloomington area business owners:</h3>
		<p>I can include your business in the locator app! Any existing users will be 
            notified updates are available.&nbsp; It could feature one touch to dial, one 
            touch to website, address, street view, navigation, directions etc.&nbsp; This 
            is a great way to get the attention of students on the most used operating 
            system of mobile phones!&nbsp; I will also consider application development 
            opportunities.&nbsp; Contact me at the email above for details.</p>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
		<p>The IU building app is touch driven and requires no typing.&nbsp; It fully 
            integrates itself with Google Maps on your mobile phone.&nbsp; It offers one 
            touch locational information for many IU Bloomington buildings.&nbsp; By using 
            the existing functionality within the google maps app and gps enabled phones, 
            you can get directions or voice activated navigation instructions to the 
            locations in the app with just a few screen touches.</p>
        <p>I have also included the <a href="https://m.iu.edu/">IU Mobile</a> website as a 
            one touch.&nbsp; This website has the look and feel of an app, but is browser 
            based.&nbsp; It includes Oncourse access, a Faculty, Student, and Staff 
            directory, Campus alerts etc.&nbsp; And just in case you cant find what you are 
            looking for, a one touch dial option for the campus operator is included.</p>
        <p>One touch street views are available for most locations (some buildings are not 
            near streets).&nbsp; This is a great way to tour the campus from anywhere or see 
            where your next class/meeting is.</p>

       	<h3>Requirements:</h3>
		<p>This app requires that the google maps app be installed on the mobile phone.&nbsp; 
            If it is not already installed, it can be found at the Android Market also as a 
            free download.</p>
        <p>I have tested on the Droid, Droid X, and Droid Incredible.&nbsp; It should work 
            on other hardware using Android OS and is compatible with Android OS 2.1 and 2.2 
            (Froyo)</p>
